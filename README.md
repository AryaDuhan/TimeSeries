## üìà Stock Price Prediction - LSTM vs. Prophet

A comprehensive **machine learning project** that predicts stock prices using two powerful time-series forecasting models: **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Prophet**.

This repository includes two main components:

-   A **fully interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time predictions and model comparison.
-   A **Jupyter Notebook (`forecasting.ipynb`)** and Python script (`forecasting.py`) for a deeper, standalone analysis.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, from data fetching and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üé® Interactive Streamlit App

### ‚úÖ Model Comparison Dashboard

The app provides a **side-by-side comparison** of the LSTM and Prophet models, allowing you to configure parameters and see the results instantly.

**Key Interface Features:**

-   **Dynamic Ticker Input** ‚Äì Analyze any stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA).
-   **Configurable Parameters** ‚Äì Adjust the date range, training split, and LSTM hyperparameters.
-   **Real-time Predictions** ‚Äì On-the-fly model training and forecasting.
-   **Performance Metrics** ‚Äì Instantly compare model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
-   **Interactive Charts** ‚Äì Visualize historical prices against LSTM and Prophet predictions.

## üèó Architectural Comparison

This project implements and compares two popular and effective time-series forecasting models.

### üîπ Model 1: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Architecture**:

-   A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to remember patterns over long sequences.
-   **PyTorch** is used for the implementation.

‚úÖ **Pros**: Excellent at capturing complex, non-linear patterns in sequential data.
‚ùå **Cons**: Can be computationally expensive and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters (time steps, epochs, hidden size).

---

### üîπ Model 2: Prophet

**Architecture**:

-   A decomposable time series model developed by Facebook.
-   It models trends, seasonality, and holidays.

‚úÖ **Pros**: Fast, robust to missing data, and works well with time series that have strong seasonal patterns. Generally requires less tuning than LSTMs.
‚ùå **Cons**: May not capture complex non-linear relationships as effectively as an LSTM.
